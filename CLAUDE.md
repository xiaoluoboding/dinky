# Dinky — Agent Rules

## App Size (Non-negotiable)

Dinky is 35 MB installed (image/video encoders plus bundled **qpdf** and its dylibs, e.g. OpenSSL). That's still the whole point: before adding **anything** — a framework, dependency, asset, font, or feature — mentally check its bundle size impact first.

**Rules:**
- Prefer Apple frameworks always: SwiftUI, Foundation, AppKit, UserNotifications, AVFoundation, etc. They're free — already in the OS, zero bundle cost.
- Never add an SPM or CocoaPods dependency without explicit approval from Derek AND a clear size justification.
- If a feature would meaningfully grow the binary (>100 KB), find a lighter native implementation or skip it.
- No Electron, no web views, no bundled runtimes, no embedded web engines. Ever.
- Assets (images, fonts) should be SVG/SF Symbols where possible. Raster assets must be justified.

**Current footprint reference:** Dinky 35 MB vs Optimage 62 MB vs ImageOptim 17.6 MB. Keep it dinky.

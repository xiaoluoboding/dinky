# Future: Universal (Intel + Apple Silicon) Dinky builds

**Status:** Backlog — not started. Derek has no reliable way to **smoke-test on real Intel hardware**, so shipping a universal DMG would be risky without borrowing a machine or CI on Intel.

**Context:** Current distributed builds are **Apple Silicon (arm64) only**; Intel users see a **slashed app icon** in Finder (architecture mismatch). Site and README already state Apple Silicon + macOS 15. See [`CLAUDE.md`](../../CLAUDE.md) for bundle-size philosophy before expanding support.

## What it would take (high level)

1. **Xcode Release:** `ARCHS = arm64 x86_64`, `ONLY_ACTIVE_ARCH = NO` for the app target so the main executable is fat.
2. **Bundled tools in `Dinky/Resources/`:** For each of `cwebp`, `avifenc`, `oxipng`, `qpdf`, `lame`, and every file under `Resources/lib/`, produce a **universal** Mach-O: `lipo -create` the current arm64 copy with **x86_64** copies (Intel Homebrew, official release tarballs, or a one-off Intel Mac export). Same `install_name_tool` / `@loader_path` story as today for `qpdf` + dylibs — duplicated for the x86_64 slice, then combined per file.
3. **Re-sign:** Keep the existing Xcode “Re-sign bundled binaries” run phase (`codesign -s - --force` on those paths after any `lipo` / `install_name_tool`).
4. **Optional code:** If relying on user-installed Homebrew on Intel, consider prepending `/usr/local/lib` to `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` where code today only mentions `/opt/homebrew/lib` (CLI already resolves `/usr/local/bin` via `DinkyEncoderPath`).

## Effort / risk (when you pick this up)

- **Feasibility:** High for someone comfortable vendoring signed binaries; mostly repetitive `lipo` + qpdf/dylib hygiene, not a rewrite.
- **Ongoing tax:** Every release refreshes **two** arch slices (or scripted universal refresh); installed size likely **~1.5–2×** native-heavy portions (ballpark **~50–70 MB** vs ~35 MB until measured).
- **Testing:** Rosetta (`arch -x86_64`) on Apple Silicon catches some x86_64 regressions; **a real Intel Mac pass** before calling Intel “supported” is still the gold standard.

When this ships, update marketing (site, README, cask notes) from “Apple Silicon only” to universal language and add release-note boilerplate.
